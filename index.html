<h1>Appearance</h1>
<b>Physique:</b><br>
In comparison to human females she is of average height, and while the woman is rather thin her body gives the illusion of pudginess. This is thanks to very pronounced hourglass curves offering plenty of shape in the chest, rear, and thigh regions. Hard muscle adds weight, and is visible under her soft tanned flesh, giving her a strange aesthetic cross of fitness and thickness.
<br><br>
<b>Hair:</b><br>
Long and naturally straight, hanging like a veil all the way to the middle of her back. It's a wholesome chocolate brown in color, which seems to be mixed with strands of deep red and dark blonde, but those additional colors are only visible under bright/plentiful lighting.
<br><br>
<b>Face:</b><br>
Ovular in shape, high cheekbones and a firm chin, although both features are gently covered by soft smooth skin. Her complexion is clear, save for the slight rosy pink shared by her full lips and cheeks. A cute button nose rests beneath a pair of oceanic blue eyes, which are bordered with long brown lashes and slender brows.
<br><br>
<h1>Personality</h1>
<b>Positives:</b><br>
Kindhearted, independent, and jovial are just a few words that can be used to describe Daisy's demeanor. She is a mostly optimistic Faerie who is open to making new friends. Thanks to the nature of her upbringing the typical prejudices of her people don't often cross her mind. When she forms a bond of friendship it is hard to break, and the woman remains steadfast and loyal to those close to her heart.
<br><br>
<b>Negatives:</b><br>
Her primary fault is her stubbornness; once the Faerie gets something in her head she sticks by it, completely caught in her own ways. This can often cause conflict between her and figures with authority. Daisy is also very naive and ignorant, often projecting her own ideals on others without considering their points of view. Even if the action isn't intentional, her lack of an ability to catch most instances reveals a buried self-centered mindset that can easily offend.

<i>"<b>[Purebloods]</b> are the direct descendants of Firstborn Sidhes and are considered to be very important to society. They are like prodigal children, spoiled nobles even if not a single drop of royalty flows through their veins. Purebloods must have either Firstborn or Pureblood parents in order to remain part of this sub-species. In appearance it is nearly impossible to tell them apart from their Firstborn ancestors, only those who know their family history would really be able to tell the difference."</i>
<br><br>
<b>Mana Sensitivity</b><br>
The Fae-kind are very sensitive to auras and mana, allowing them to feel or see when another being is drawing from their mana pool or activating their mana, even if something is blocking their vision (assuming the blockage is Mage rank and under), a faint outline of an aura can be seen--or sensed--so long as the fellow magic user is within a twenty foot radius of the Fae (and they are actively being focused on). They cannot tell how much mana is being used or the user has left over, they are merely sensitive to when it is currently in use within the radius.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Speed</b><br>
The body of the Fae-kind is light, petite, and athletic. They can move double the speed of the average human and the strongest Fae's speeds can rival that of a hummingbird's.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Flexibility</b><br>
Their bodies are as flexible as they are light, allowing them to contort their shapes into absurd formations. Something someone would expect to see in a circus act.
<br><br>
<b>Burning Calories</b><br>
The Fae-kind eat thousands upon thousands of calories on purpose and burn them off very quickly. Physical sugary foods is said to help their mental and magic stability, often allowing them slightly faster mana regeneration than what is average if consumed when their mana-pool is either completely drained or close to it.
<br><br>
<b>Hidden Wings</b><br>
Tribal-like wing markings cover the backs of the Sidhe-kind. These tribal markings cause winged silhouettes to form as an aura behind each individual Faerie when they dip into their mana pool, the kind of wings that manifest can differ from person to person, but the most common is the shape of a butterfly.

<h1>High Archmage: Creationism</h1>
Nature in the Faerie Realms exists a little differently. While in most worlds there are special classifications for things believed to naturally be potent with magic for sometimes inexplicable reasons, every single tangible--and even intangible--substance in the Faerie Realms is saturated with the arcane. Magic birthed the entire realm from human dreams and fantasy, and as a result nature based magic is far more difficult to master, and complex to learn. Every single being born into the realm from its inhabitants and from the Dream, whether they be sentient or completely inanimate, is connected by a primal core energy into a giant web of individuality. This particular Pureblood has not only learned how to manipulate this primeval "basely rooted" magic, she can also re-create it into creatures and events of her own. It is possible for her to even change the core make-up of this energy, allowing her to transmute materials into other materials entirely, or even change their state of matter between solids, liquids, and gasses at will. This is a secondary ability, however, and while it can be mixed with her magic's primary focus it is still far more limited.

<h1>What is this Troop?</h1>
The <a target="_blank" href="https://thefaerierealms.wixsite.com/rowan-troop">Rowan Troop</a> is a group role-play this character was made to participate in. She can be used outside of it, however, I'm not much for one-on-one's in private messages so unless there's another group she can fit in, or a casual role-play spot, I likely won't agree to an interaction. If you'd like to check it out you're welcome to, unfortunately it isn't accepting any members at the moment. Clicking the green words will take you to its wix.
